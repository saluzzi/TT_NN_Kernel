It was used to carry out the numerical experiments and generate the figures for the publication.
The experiments were performed on Linux systems in 2024 and should work with Python and matlab versions of that time.


## Installation

To run the python experiments, create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages.
For convenience, this steps can be done with help of the `setup_python_experiments.sh` file.
To activate the virtual environment, use `source venv/bin/activate`.
In order to reproduce the experiments, run the respective files.
